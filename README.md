R code to calculate banner-based player rankings for DCSS 0.20 tournament

This is intended as an alternate method of calculating player rankings for the online Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup 0.20 release tournament.  This method uses the banners that players can earn for achievements as a basis for scoring instead of the tournament's actual scoring method.

Each player is given credit only for the highest achievement they earn in each category.  Each banner gets a score based upon how many players achieved it and how many players achieved the most popular achievement.  For example, in this tournament, the most popular achievement was "Vow of Courage I" (kill Sigmund before entering the Depths).  1625 achieved that banner and no higher Vow of Courage banner.  All banners are scored by dividing the 1625 by the number of players who earned that achievement.  That sets the score for Vow of Courage I to 1 point (1625/1625), while the score for an achievement gotten by X players has a score of 1625/X.  For example, 20 players getting an achievement under this system would earn 1625/20=81.25 points.

Naturally, this isn't the only manner in which banner points could be scored, and so I've provided a text file of the final rankings for every player who earned at least one banner (players_banner_rankings.txt) as well as a CSV file of every player and every banner they earned (players_banner_rankings.csv).
