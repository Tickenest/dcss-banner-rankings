#calculate the number of players who achieved each level.  Then, figure out
#which banner was the most popular (so players who didn't achieve ANY banners
#don't alter the calculations.)  To calculate the value of each banner, divide
#the number of players who got the most popular banner by the number of players
#who got each banner.  So if 1000 players got the most popular banner, that
#banner is worth 1000/1000 = 1 point.  If 1 player got a particular banner, then
#that banner is worth 1000/1 = 1000 points.  If 50 players got a particular
#banner, then that banner is worth 1000/50 = 20 points.
